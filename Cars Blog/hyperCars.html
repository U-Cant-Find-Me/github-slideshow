            they are not. This know it all guide explains what it means to be a hypercar.</h6>

                <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                <p>Have you ever heard of a hypercar and thought to yourself, what makes a car a ‘hypercar’? It
                    seems
                    anyone on the internet, especially on social media has their thoughts and opinions branding them
                    as
                    a ‘hypercar’ when they are not. This know it all guide explains what it means to be a
                    hypercar.<br>When you hear the term supercar, you know that the vehicle is special, a rarity,
                    perhaps an exotic model;
                    when you hear the term hypercar, you know that the vehicle is one of the top performers on the
                    planet. The big supercar/hypercar differences are design, performance, and rarity — a supercar
                    is a
                    world-class vehicle, but a hypercar pushes the boundaries of the possible while generally being
                    produced in more limited quantities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-6">
                <h3><strong>Hypercar</strong></h3>
                <p>A hypercar can be defined as the most superior and high-performance cars on the market worldwide.
                    Only 1% of cars are hypercars, the first one was produced in 1963, the Lamborghini Miura. This
                    was
                    also known as the P400. The Lamborghini Miura can accelerate to 60mph in under 6 seconds and on
                    to a
                    top speed of 180mph whereas one of the newest hypercars on the market can go from 0-186mph in
                    under
                    9 seconds! This hypercar is the Lotus Evija electric hypercar (pronounced ih-via), the name
                    means
                    ‘the living one’. The Lotus Evija is highly exclusive as only 130 will ever be built. This puts
                    the
                    Lotus Evija at the top as the most powerful supercar to ever be built plus it is fully electric
                    taking only 18 minutes on a 350-kilowatt charge. If you have a spare £2 million sat in your bank
                    account then this Lotus Evija could be yours.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
                <p>Supercars and hypercars are not mere race cars — they’re high-performance cars that will leave
                    any
                    garden-variety sports car in the dust in terms of both general performance and of lap times on
                    the
                    track. But while supercars tend to take an iterative approach to design, taking the most
                    cutting-edge technology and aerodynamic engineering and making it slightly better with every
                    release, hypercars tend to do something entirely new to push the envelope in every way possible.
                    For example, before the LaFerrari burst onto the scene, the idea of a hybrid that offered
                    world-class performance was thought to be impossible. But Ferrari innovated by pairing a
                    naturally
                    aspirated V12 engine with an electric motor. Its HY-KERS hybrid powertrain is derived from
                    Formula 1
                    technology, offering incredible performance with surprising efficiency. And mosti importantly,
                    its
                    speed backs up its claim to hypercar status: it boasts a top speed of 218 mph and can sprint
                    from a
                    standstill to 60 mph in just 2.4 seconds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>The core elements of a Hypercar</strong></h3>
                <p>Here we discuss the main elements that make up a Hypercar. Differentiating this from your average
                    daily commute to work car to the top of the range Supercar.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Limited releases</strong></h3>
                <p>Hypercars are exclusive, car manufacturer Lotus has recently released the new electric car, Lotus
                    Evija and will only make 130 of them ever. It is possible to rent supercars around £20,000 for
                    24
                    hours but it will most likely only be for movie productions, photoshoots, and trade shows.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Appearance</strong></h3>
                <p>The world's high-performance cars have mind-blowing designs. These cars are unique and
                    individual,
                    we are instantly drawn to their design and appearance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>
                <p>The top speeds of hypercars are going to be higher than those of supercars, simply because of their
                    commitment to doing what was thought impossible. For example, a supercar like the Ferrari 488 GTB is
                    no slouch, with a top speed of 205 mph and a 0-60-mph time of 3 seconds. But if you look at a
                    supercar like the hybrid Ferrari SF90 Stradale, it’s significantly faster, with a top speed of 217
                    mph and a 0-60-mph time of 2.6 seconds.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3><strong>Build quality</strong></h3>
                <p>The build quality is what differentiates a hypercar from a sports car and a supercar is the build
                    quality. Although a high performance hypercar is meant to be designed for elegance and high speeds,
                    they need to last and thrive seen as many cars cannot maintain high speeds, especially above 100
                    miles per hour to ensure they do not become unsafe. Referring back to the cost, they are expensive
                    and need to be built to a top quality standard to ensure the safety of the driver, passengers, and
                    road drivers.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h3><strong>Rarity</strong></h3>
                <p>The production numbers of both supercars and hypercars tend to be very limited, though in most cases
                    hypercars are a much rarer commodity. For instance, approximately 7,900 Ferrari California T
                    supercars were produced, while only 500 LaFerrari hypercars were made. And if you want a convertible
                    version of Ferrari’s famous hybrid hypercar, it’s even harder to find: only 210 LaFerrari Aperta
                    models were produced.</p>

                    electric motor drives the rear wheels in parallel with the engine and also serves as the main
                    generator. This motor and engine deliver power to the rear axle via a 7-speed gearbox coupled to
                    Porsche's own PDK double-clutch system. The front 95 kW (129 PS; 127 hp) electric motor directly
                    drives the front axle; an electric clutch decouples the motor when not in use. The total system
                    delivers 652 kW (887 PS; 875 hp) and 1,280 N⋅m (944 lbf⋅ft) of torque. Porsche provided official
                    performance figures of 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.6 seconds, 0-200 km/h (124 mph) in 7.2 seconds,

                    (4.0 L; 243.7 cu in) twin-turbocharged V8 engine codenamed the M840TR. It utilises a seven-speed
                    dual-clutch transmission that delivers all 800 PS (588 kW; 789 hp) at 7,250 rpm and 590 lb⋅ft (800

                    1,198 kg (2,641 lb), which allows for a maximum power-to-weight ratio of 667 PS (491 kW; 658 hp) per

                <p class="lead">The P1 features a 3.8 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine. The twin turbos boost the petrol
                    engine at 1.4 bar (20.3 psi) to deliver 542 kW; 727 hp at 7,500 rpm and 720 N⋅m of torque at 4,000
                    rpm, combined with an in-house-developed electric motor producing 132 kW; 177 hp and 260 N⋅m of
                    torque. The electric motor and the petrol engine in the P1, produce a combined power output of 674
                    kW (903 hp) and 900 N⋅m of torque. The electric motor can be deployed manually by the driver or
                    left in automatic mode. This gives the powertrain an effective powerband of almost 7,000
                    rpm. The car has rear-wheel-drive layout and is equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.
                    According to McLaren the P1 accelerates from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124
                    mph) in 6.8 seconds, and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 16.5 seconds. The P1 is electronically limited to
                    a top speed of 350 km/h (217 mph). According to McLaren it takes 6.2 seconds to brake from 300

                    two narrow-angle V8 engines bolted together. Each cylinder has four valves for a total of 64, but
                    the configuration of each bank allows two overhead camshafts to drive two banks of cylinders so only
                    four camshafts are needed. The engine is fed by four turbochargers and displaces 7,993 cc with a
                    square 86 by 86 mm (3.39 by 3.39 in) bore and stroke.The transmission is a dual-clutch direct-shift
                    computer-controlled automatic transmission having seven gear ratios, with magnesium paddles behind
                    the steering wheel and a shift time of less than 150 milliseconds,This top speed was almost matched
                    by James May on Top Gear in November 2006, at the Ehra-Lessien test track, at 407.5 km/h (253.2
                    mph). May noted that at top speed the engine consumes 45,000 L of air per minute. May responded that
                    the Veyron was very controlled, and only wobbled slightly when the air brake deployed. The car's
